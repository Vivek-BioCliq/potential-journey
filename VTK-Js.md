# VTK.js
- VTK.js is a JavaScript library that allows for 3D visualization in web applications.
- vtk.js is a rendering library made for Scientific Visualization on the Web.
- It's based on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), a powerful open-source software system used for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. 
- VTK.js enables developers to create interactive and immersive 3D visualizations directly within web browsers using WebGL.
- This library provides a wide range of tools and functionalities for creating visualizations, handling datasets, rendering, and interacting with 3D scenes. 
- It's commonly used in scientific and engineering applications where 3D visualization of complex data is required, such as medical imaging, computational fluid dynamics, and simulations.

In VTK.js, you can work with lights, vertices, and directions to create and manipulate 3D scenes and visualizations.

1. **Lights:**
   Lights are essential for illuminating scenes in 3D visualization. VTK.js allows you to create various types of lights, such as ambient, directional, point, and spotlight. These lights can be positioned, oriented, and colored to achieve different lighting effects in your scene. For example, you can adjust the intensity, color, and position of a directional light to simulate sunlight.

2. **Vertices:**
   Vertices represent the points in a 3D space that define shapes or objects. In VTK.js, you can create geometries by specifying vertices and connecting them to form shapes like triangles or polygons. Manipulating vertices allows you to create and modify objects in your scene, defining their position, shape, and structure.

3. **Directions:**
   Directions typically refer to vectors that indicate the orientation or movement in a certain direction in 3D space. These can be used to define the orientation of objects, the direction of light sources, or even the direction of a camera in your scene. Manipulating directions involves working with vector mathematics to set orientations or trajectories.

To work with these elements in VTK.js, you'll typically create objects or components (such as lights, geometries, or vectors) and then manipulate their properties through the VTK.js API, adjusting parameters like position, orientation, color, intensity, etc., to achieve the desired visual effects or behavior in your 3D scene.
