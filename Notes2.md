# KUB
- KUB refers to a medical imaging technique called a Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder X-ray.
- This imaging test allows doctors to visualize these organs to detect any abnormalities, stones, or issues in urinary system and surroundings.
- The file format of a KUB X-ray images are saved in 'DICOM' file format.
- The image produced by a KUB X-ray is a 2D representation.
- The resulting image shows the kidneys, ureters, and bladder
- The image produced by a KUB X-ray is typically in grayscale (varying shades of gray).

# nii Images
- The Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) is an open file format commonly used to store brain imaging data obtained using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) method.
- NII files contain information about the structure of the brain.
- NIfTI files typically have the extensions .nii or .nii.gz (if compressed).
- Brain images in NIfTI format are represented as a 3D or 4D matrix of voxels (volumetric pixels).
- NIfTI files include header information that describes the image data, such as dimensions, voxel size, data type, orientation, and other metadata like patient information, acquisition parameters, and study details.
